# about

hello! and welcome to the companion documentation for the ralsei library. this documentation is not
for the library itself, [that can be found here](https://docs.rs/ralsei). instead, it intends to
provide a comprehensive overview of various file formats, apis, and other points of interest with
regard to nintendo's 3ds and wii u console families
